= 0.9.4 merb_cache_more, released 2008-05-27:

= Changes in behavior from merb-cache:

== Support query string params
  * generate unique keys when params are present
  * retain existing behavior when they are not
  * preserve order of query params
  * patch merb-core request methods query_parse and params_to_query_string to 
    allow use of Dictionary (ie. preserve order)
  * allow :params => false to disable inclusion
  * support out-of-the-box compatibility with merb_paginate
  * change default key format from tree to snake pairs (tree can be cpu 
    intensive and expose filesystem problems on deep nested keys)
  * added dependency 'digest/md5'

== DRY out action/page cache methods
  * unify use of key_for instead of request.path

== Sanitize_cache_key method
  * remove illegal posix/win32 filesystem chars
  * designed to be overridden by user to help match urls on nginx/apache

== Added global config settings
  * :cache_action_ttl - action cache expiry time
  * :cache_page_ttl - page cache expiry time
  * :cache_key_format - cache key style/format

== Added options to controller caching
  * :format - key format (overrides global config)
  * :params - include only these params

== Fix multiple cache_pages, cache_actions
  * allow combinations of arrays and symbols

== Provide :all option for action/page caching
  * makes all actions in controller cacheable
  * use :exclude option to exclude actions
  * statment must appear at end of class declaration

== Support various key formats
  * nil - default snake case using param key-pairs
  * :snake - snake case using param values
  * :hash - MD5 hashed key
  * :query - escaped querystring
  * :tree - folder tree (limited to 10 levels)
  * custom - ":paramname1/:paramname2_and_:paramname3" where param names are 
    substituted by their values

== Add rspecs tests with params
  * patch merb-core test request helper to allow querystring to be passed in 
    without being overwritten by fake dispatch
  * remove :id and :format params from query string (they would not be there 
    unless specifically called like "?id=1&format=html")
  * key generator tests for simple/complex urls
  * add controller actions with params
  * page/action cache and expiration tests with params
  * modified some existing tests to use new default snake case key format
    
== To do:
  * make multiple cache :all work whether or not statement comes before or 
    after methods in controller class declaration
  * polish up comments/examples
